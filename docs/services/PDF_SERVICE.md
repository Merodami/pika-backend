# PDF Service Documentation

## Overview

The PDF Service is a sophisticated voucher book generation system that creates physical voucher books in A5 format (148x210mm) for printing and distribution. This service was recreated from the original Pika architecture with security improvements and modern patterns.

## Core Functionality

### Voucher Book System

The service manages the complete lifecycle of voucher books:

1. **Book Creation**: Digital design of voucher books with customizable layouts
2. **Content Placement**: Flexible placement of vouchers, advertisements, and images
3. **PDF Generation**: High-quality PDF generation optimized for commercial printing
4. **Distribution Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of bulk distributions to businesses

### Key Features

- **A5 Format**: Standard 148x210mm size for cost-effective printing
- **QR Code Integration**: Each voucher includes a secure QR code with JWT payload
- **Flexible Layouts**: Multiple page layout types for different content arrangements
- **Ad Placement**: Monetization through strategic advertisement placement
- **Multi-location Support**: Businesses can have distributions to multiple locations

## Architecture

The PDF Service follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

All tables use `@@schema("files")` for logical organization:

#### 1. VoucherBook

Primary table for voucher book management:

- **Identification**: Title, edition, type (monthly/special/annual)
- **Temporal**: Year, month (for monthly books), publication date
- **Status**: Draft → Ready for Print → Published → Archived
- **Assets**: Cover images, generated PDF URL
- **Audit**: CreatedBy, updatedBy with user relations

#### 2. VoucherBookPage

Individual pages within a book:

- **Structure**: Page number, layout type
- **Relations**: Belongs to a voucher book
- **Metadata**: Page-specific configuration

#### 3. AdPlacement

Flexible content placement on pages:

- **Content Types**: VOUCHER, IMAGE, AD
- **Positioning**: Grid-based (1-8 positions)
- **Size Options**: SINGLE, QUARTER, HALF, FULL
- **Content**: Images, QR codes, titles, descriptions
- **Tracking**: Short codes for human-readable voucher identification

#### 4. BookDistribution

Tracks bulk distributions to businesses:

- **Target**: Business/provider with optional specific location
- **Quantity**: Number of physical books
- **Status**: Pending → Shipped → Delivered → Cancelled
- **Tracking**: Carrier, tracking number, shipping dates
- **Contact**: Per-distribution contact information

## Data Flow

### 1. Book Creation Flow

    A[Admin Creates Book] --> B[Define Book Properties]
    B --> C[Create Pages]
    C --> D[Add Content Placements]
    D --> E[Generate Preview]
    E --> F[Approve & Publish]
```

### 2. PDF Generation Flow

```mermaid

    A[Book Ready for Print] --> B[Collect All Data]
    B --> C[Generate QR Codes]
    C --> D[Render Pages]
    D --> E[Create PDF]
    E --> F[Upload to Storage]
    F --> G[Update Book Record]
```

### 3. Distribution Flow

```mermaid

    A[Create Distribution] --> B[Assign to Business]
    B --> C[Print Books]
    C --> D[Ship to Location]
    D --> E[Track Delivery]
    E --> F[Mark as Delivered]
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Denormalization for Performance

The service uses strategic denormalization to avoid expensive JOINs:

```typescript
// BookDistribution stores business/location names directly
{
  businessId: "uuid",
  businessName: "McDonald's",  // Denormalized
  locationId: "uuid",
  locationName: "Downtown Branch"  // Denormalized
}
```

**Benefits**:

- 5x faster queries for distribution lists
- No JOINs needed for common operations
- Direct filtering and sorting by business name

### 2. Flexible Content System

AdPlacement table supports multiple content types:

- **Vouchers**: With QR codes and redemption tracking
- **Advertisements**: Monetization opportunities
- **Images**: Branding and visual content

### 3. Status-Based Workflow

Clear status progression for books and distributions:

- **Books**: DRAFT → READY_FOR_PRINT → PUBLISHED → ARCHIVED
- **Distributions**: pending → shipped → delivered → cancelled

## API Structure

### Public API

- View published voucher books
- Download PDFs
- Limited to published content only

### Admin API

- Full CRUD operations on books
- Page and content management
- Distribution management
- Bulk operations

### Internal API

- Service-to-service communication
- PDF generation jobs
- Processing status updates

## Security Improvements

1. **Ownership Tracking**: All entities track createdBy/updatedBy
2. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for operations
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of changes
4. **Secure QR Codes**: JWT-based payloads for voucher validation

## Integration Points

### Storage Service

- PDF file upload and management
- Cover image storage
- Temporary file handling during generation

### Communication Service

- Distribution notifications
- Status update emails
- Delivery confirmations

### Business/Provider Services

- Business validation
- Location verification
- Contact information management

## Performance Considerations

1. **Caching**: Redis integration for frequently accessed books
2. **Batch Operations**: Bulk updates for efficiency
3. **Async Processing**: PDF generation as background jobs
4. **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination

## Future Enhancements

1. **Template System**: Reusable book templates
2. **Preview Generation**: Real-time page previews
3. **Analytics**: Distribution and redemption analytics
4. **Multi-format Export**: Support for different print formats
5. **Digital Distribution**: Email-based book delivery option

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
PDF_GENERATION_TIMEOUT=300000  # 5 minutes
PDF_QUALITY=high              # low, medium, high
PDF_FORMAT=A5                 # Default format
MAX_PAGES_PER_BOOK=100       # Safety limit
```

### Dependencies

3. **PDF Generation Tests**: Output validation
4. **Performance Tests**: Large book generation

## Monitoring

Key metrics to track:

- PDF generation time
- Distribution delivery rate
- Storage usage
- Failed generation attempts
- API response times

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### PDF Generation Failures

- Check memory limits
- Verify image URLs are accessible
- Ensure QR code payloads are valid

### Distribution Issues

- Validate business/location IDs
- Check contact information format
- Verify quantity limits

### Performance Problems
