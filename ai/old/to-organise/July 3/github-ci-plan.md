# GitHub CI/CD Implementation Plan for Solo60

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive, battle-tested GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for the Solo60 monorepo project. The implementation follows industry best practices for Node.js/TypeScript projects, with special considerations for NX monorepos, microservices architecture, and Yarn Berry (v4) package management.

## Project Context

- **Architecture**: NX-based microservices monorepo
- **Runtime**: Node.js 22.x with ESM modules
- **Package Manager**: Yarn 4.9.1 (Berry) with workspaces
- **Build Tool**: NX 21.2.1 for orchestration
- **Testing**: Vitest with Testcontainers for integration tests
- **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Stripe Mock
- **Branches**: `main` (production), `dev` (development)

## Workflow Architecture

### 1. Branch Strategy & Triggers

```yaml
# Main workflow triggers
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, dev]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, dev]
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
```

### 2. Workflow Structure

We'll implement multiple specialized workflows:

1. **CI Pipeline** (`ci.yml`) - Main continuous integration workflow
2. **Deploy Production** (`deploy-prod.yml`) - Production deployment (main branch)
3. **Deploy Development** (`deploy-dev.yml`) - Development deployment (dev branch)
4. **Dependency Check** (`dependency-check.yml`) - Weekly security audits
5. **Release** (`release.yml`) - Automated versioning and releases

## Detailed CI Pipeline Implementation

### Phase 1: Environment Setup & Caching

#### 1.1 Caching Strategy

**Multi-layer caching approach:**

1. **Yarn Cache** - Berry's global cache directory
2. **Node Modules** - Fallback for packages with scripts
3. **NX Cache** - Build artifacts and computation cache
4. **Docker Layer Cache** - For test containers
5. **Prisma Engine Cache** - Binary engines for Prisma

```yaml
cache-keys:
  yarn: yarn-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('yarn.lock', '.yarnrc.yml') }}
  nx: nx-${{ runner.os }}-${{ github.sha }}
  prisma: prisma-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('**/prisma/schema.prisma') }}
  docker: docker-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles('docker-compose.*.yml') }}
```

#### 1.2 Environment Variables

**Required GitHub Secrets:**

```yaml
# Database
PG_HOST
PG_PORT
PG_DATABASE
PG_USER
PG_PASSWORD
DATABASE_URL

# Redis
REDIS_HOST
REDIS_PORT
REDIS_PASSWORD

# Authentication

  needs: [build, unit-tests]
  environment: development
  steps:
    - Build and deploy to dev environment
    - Run smoke tests
```

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Parallel Execution

- **Matrix builds** for different Node versions or OS
- **Sharded tests** for faster test execution
- **Parallel NX commands** with `--parallel=100`
- **Concurrent job execution** where dependencies allow

### 2. Selective Testing

```yaml
# Only test affected projects on PRs
- name: Test Affected
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  run: yarn test:affected:ci
```

### 3. Docker Optimization

```yaml
# Use Docker BuildKit for faster builds
- name: Build Docker Images
  env:
    DOCKER_BUILDKIT: 1
    COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD: 1
  run: |
    docker compose -f docker-compose.ci.yml build --parallel
```

### 4. Artifact Management

```yaml
# Only upload artifacts on failure
- name: Upload Test Results
  if: failure()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: test-results
    path: |
      coverage/
      test-results/
    retention-days: 7
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Secret Management

- Use GitHub Environments for production secrets
- Implement secret rotation policies
- Use OIDC for cloud provider authentication
- Never log sensitive information

### 2. Dependency Scanning

```yaml
# Weekly dependency audit
- name: Audit Dependencies
  run: |
    yarn audit
    yarn nx run-many --target=audit --all
```

### 3. Code Scanning

- Enable GitHub Advanced Security
- Configure CodeQL analysis
- Implement SAST tools
- Regular vulnerability scanning

## Monitoring & Notifications

### 1. Status Checks

Required status checks for PRs:

- All tests passing
- Code coverage above threshold (80%)
- No linting errors
- Type checking passes
- Build successful

### 2. Notifications

```yaml
# Slack/Discord notifications
- name: Notify Deployment
  if: always()
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

### 3. Metrics & Observability

- Build time tracking
- Test execution metrics
- Cache hit rates
- Deployment frequency

strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest] # Consider self-hosted for heavy workloads
```

### 2. Conditional Workflows

```yaml
# Skip CI for documentation changes
paths-ignore:
  - '**.md'
  - 'docs/**'
  - '.github/**.md'
```

### 3. Resource Management

- Cancel in-progress runs for outdated commits
- Use concurrency groups
- Implement job timeouts
- Clean up old artifacts

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Yarn Berry Issues**
   - Ensure `.yarnrc.yml` is committed
