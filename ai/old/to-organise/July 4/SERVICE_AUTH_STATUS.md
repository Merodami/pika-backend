# Service-to-Service Authentication Status

## Date: 2025-07-04

## Summary

The internal service-to-service authentication infrastructure has been implemented but requires configuration fixes to work properly.

## Current Implementation

### 1. Authentication Mechanism

- Services authenticate with each other using `x-api-key` header
- Additional headers required: `x-service-name` and `x-service-id`
- The `requireServiceAuth()` middleware validates these headers

### 2. Service Client Pattern

All service clients inherit from `BaseServiceClient` which:

- Automatically adds service identification headers
- Uses `useServiceAuth: true` flag to trigger API key authentication
- HttpClient interceptor adds the `x-api-key` header when this flag is set

### 3. Communication Service Updates

#### Created Internal Routes (`InternalCommunicationRoutes.ts`)

- Protected by `requireServiceAuth()` middleware
- Mounted at `/internal/*` prefix
- Endpoints:
  - POST `/internal/emails/send` - Send emails with service auth
  - POST `/internal/emails/transactional` - Send transactional emails
  - POST `/internal/notifications/system` - Send system notifications

#### Updated Public Routes

- Modified `/emails/send` to use `allowServiceOrUserAuth()`
- This allows both JWT (user) and API key (service) authentication

#### Created Internal Controller (`InternalCommunicationController.ts`)

- Handles service-to-service email and notification requests
- Logs service identification for audit trail

### 4. Type System Updates

- Added `CommunicationChannel` enum to `@solo60/types`:
  ```typescript
  export enum CommunicationChannel {
    IN_APP = 'IN_APP',
    EMAIL = 'EMAIL',
    PUSH = 'PUSH',
    SMS = 'SMS',
  }
  ```

## Issues Found

### 1. SERVICE_API_KEY Configuration Mismatch

**Problem**: The services are not accepting the SERVICE_API_KEY from the environment.

**Evidence**:

- .env has: `SERVICE_API_KEY=dev-service-api-key-change-in-production`
- Test script gets: `SERVICE_API_KEY=default-service-api-key` (fallback value)
- Services reject both values with "Invalid or missing service authentication"

**Root Cause**: Either:

1. Services are not loading the SERVICE_API_KEY from environment properly
2. Services are configured with a different API key
3. The middleware comparison is failing

### 2. Environment Loading in Scripts

- Scripts running with `tsx` are not loading .env files properly
- The `@solo60/environment` module shows fallback values instead of .env values

## Test Results

Created `test-service-auth.ts` script that tests:

1. ✅ Unauthenticated requests are rejected
2. ❌ Service authenticated requests fail (API key mismatch)
3. ❌ Communication service endpoints fail with service auth
4. ✅ Invalid API keys are properly rejected

## What's Working

1. **Infrastructure**: All middleware and client code is in place
2. **Security**: Unauthenticated requests are properly rejected
3. **Type Safety**: All schemas and types are properly defined
4. **Compilation**: All code compiles without errors

## What Needs Fixing

1. **SERVICE_API_KEY Configuration**
   - Ensure all services load the same SERVICE_API_KEY from environment
   - Verify the middleware is comparing the correct values
   - Check if services need restart after .env changes

2. **Email Service Integration**
   - Once auth is fixed, the email sending should work
   - The auth service is properly configured to use service auth

## Next Steps

1. **Debug SERVICE_API_KEY Loading**
   - Check how services load environment variables on startup
   - Verify SERVICE_API_KEY is available in each service
   - Add debug logging to `requireServiceAuth` middleware

2. **Test with Running Services**
   - Restart all services to ensure they load latest environment
   - Use curl or Postman to test service endpoints directly
   - Check service logs for authentication failures

3. **Complete Email Verification Flow**
   - Once service auth works, email verification will be fully functional
   - Auth service will be able to call communication service

## Code Quality

- ✅ All TypeScript types properly defined
- ✅ Clean Architecture maintained
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Security best practices followed
