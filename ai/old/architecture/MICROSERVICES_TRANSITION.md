# Microservices Transition Report

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the transition strategy from the monolithic architecture (previous-architecture) to the new microservices architecture. The analysis identifies service boundaries, dependencies, and proposes a migration roadmap for the Solo60 platform.

## Current State Analysis

### Previous Architecture (Monolith)

- **Technology**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: Single PostgreSQL instance via Prisma
- **Architecture**: Service layer pattern with tightly coupled services
- **Validation**: Legacy validation patterns
- **Total Services**: 18 service files with complex interdependencies

### New Architecture (Microservices)

- **Technology**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: Shared PostgreSQL (potential for schema separation)
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository)
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation with type-safe middleware
- **Communication**: REST APIs through API Gateway

## Service Grouping Strategy

Based on domain boundaries and data coupling analysis, the following microservices are proposed:

### 1. **User & Profile Service** (Port: 5501) ‚úÖ Fully Migrated

**Combines from monolith:**

- `user.ts` - User profile management
- `professional.ts` - Professional/trainer profiles
- `parq.ts` - Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire

**Implementation Status**: Complete with full CRUD operations, admin features, and 2 test files

**Rationale**: These services share user identity and profile data. PARQ is directly tied to user fitness profiles.

**Dependencies**: Auth Service

### 2. **Auth Service** (Port: 5502) ‚úÖ Fully Migrated

**Combines from monolith:**

- `cognito.ts` - AWS Cognito integration
- Authentication logic from `user.ts`

**Implementation Status**: Complete JWT authentication system with login/register (‚ö†Ô∏è Needs tests)

**Rationale**: Centralized authentication and authorization. Critical foundational service.

**Dependencies**: None (foundational service)

### 3. **Gym & Location Service** (Port: 5503) ‚úÖ Fully Migrated

**Combines from monolith:**

- `gym.ts` - Gym management and search
- `stuff.ts` - Equipment and amenities
- Geolocation utilities

**Rationale**: Equipment/amenities are properties of gyms. Location search is core to gym discovery.

**Dependencies**: None

### 4. **Session & Booking Service** (Port: 5504) ‚úÖ Fully Migrated

**Combines from monolith:**

- `session.ts` - Session booking logic (41KB - most complex)
- `sessionInvitee.ts` - Invitation management
- `waitingList.ts` - Waiting list management
- `sessionReview.ts` - Session feedback

**Implementation Status**: Complete booking system with 1 comprehensive test file

**Rationale**: These services form the core booking workflow and share session context.

**Features Implemented:**

**Dependencies**: User Service

### 6. **Subscription & Membership Service** (Port: 5506) ‚úÖ Fully Migrated

**Combines from monolith:**

- `subscription.ts` - Subscription management
- `membership.ts` - Membership tiers

**Implementation Status**: Complete subscription system with 2 test files

**Dependencies**: Payment Service, User Service

### 7. **Communication Service** (Port: 5507) ‚úÖ Fully Migrated

**Combines from monolith:**

- `email.ts` - Email sending
- `notification.ts` - In-app notifications
- Template management (new feature)

**Implementation Status**: Complete communication system (‚ö†Ô∏è Needs tests)

**Rationale**: Centralized communication channel management with support for multiple providers (AWS SES, Resend, Console).

**Features Implemented:**

- Multi-provider email support with fallback (AWS SES, Resend, Console)
- Template management system with variable substitution
- Bulk email capabilities
- Communication history tracking

**Implementation Status**: Complete support system with 1 test file

**Rationale**: Isolated support workflow with minimal dependencies.

**Features Implemented:**

- Problem reporting and tracking
- Admin problem management

**Dependencies**: User Service, Communication Service

### 9. **Social Service** (Port: 5509) ‚úÖ Fully Migrated

**Combines from monolith:**

- `friend.ts` - Friend/connection management
- Social features from session invitations

**Implementation Status**: Complete social platform with 1 comprehensive test file

**Rationale**: Social graph management separate from core business logic.

**Features Implemented:**

- Friend management with status workflow (PENDING/ACCEPTED/DECLINED/BLOCKED)
- Following/follower asymmetric relationships
- Activity feeds (personal, discovery, trending)
- Social interactions (likes, comments, shares, bookmarks)
- Session social features and invitations

## Technical Considerations

### Data Migration Strategy

1. **Shared Database Approach** (Recommended for Phase 1)
   - All services share the same PostgreSQL instance
   - Use schema prefixes for logical separation
   - Minimal migration effort

2. **Database per Service** (Future State)
   - Migrate to separate databases as services mature
   - Use event sourcing for data synchronization
   - Implement saga pattern for distributed transactions

### Inter-Service Communication

1. **Synchronous**: REST APIs through API Gateway
2. **Asynchronous**: Consider message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for:
   - Email/notification delivery
   - Credit balance updates
   - Session booking workflows

### Service Boundaries

- **Strong Boundaries**: Auth, File Storage, Communication
- **Coupled Services**: Session & Booking heavily depends on multiple services
- **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its domain data

### Migration Patterns

1. **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Gradually replace monolith endpoints
2. **API Gateway**: Route traffic between old and new services
3. **Feature Flags**: Control rollout of new services
4. **Database Views**: Share data during transition

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Session Booking Service** - Most complex business logic
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, gradual migration
2. **Payment Service** - Financial data sensitivity
   - Mitigation: Audit trail, extensive validation
3. **Data Consistency** - Distributed transactions
   - Mitigation: Saga pattern, eventual consistency

### Testing Strategy

1. **Integration Tests**: Test service interactions
2. **Contract Tests**: Ensure API compatibility
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Validate complete workflows
4. **Load Tests**: Verify performance under load

## Success Metrics

1. **Service Isolation**: < 3 dependencies per service
2. **API Response Time**: < 200ms p95
3. **Deployment Independence**: Services deployed without coordination
4. **Development Velocity**: Faster feature delivery
5. **System Reliability**: > 99.9% uptime

## Next Steps

1. Complete User & Profile Service migration
2. Implement File Storage Service
3. Begin Gym & Location Service migration
4. Set up monitoring and observability
5. Establish service communication patterns
