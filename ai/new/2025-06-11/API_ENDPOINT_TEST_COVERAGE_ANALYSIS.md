- `PUT /notifications/read-all` - Mark all as read ❌ **MISSING TEST**

**Missing Coverage**: The bulk read operation endpoint lacks test coverage.

## Test Infrastructure Analysis

### Strengths

1. **Real Database Testing**: All services use Testcontainers for PostgreSQL
2. **RBAC Implementation**: Comprehensive role-based access control testing
3. **Error Handling**: Good coverage of error scenarios and validation
4. **Multilingual Support**: Tests include Spanish, English, and Guaraní
5. **Integration Testing**: Real API calls with proper authentication

### Testing Patterns

```typescript
// Common test structure across services
describe('Service Integration Tests', () => {
  let app: FastifyInstance
  let container: StartedPostgreSqlContainer

  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Start test container
    // Run migrations
    // Seed test data
  })

  describe('Endpoint Tests', () => {
    it('should handle CRUD operations', async () => {
      const response = await app.inject({
        method: 'POST',
        url: '/endpoint',
        headers: { 'x-user-id': userId },
        payload: testData,
      })
      expect(response.statusCode).toBe(201)
    })
  })
})
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)

1. **Messaging Service**: Add explicit HTTP endpoint tests for GET operations
   - Test GET /conversations with pagination and filters
   - Test GET /messages with conversation context

2. **User Service**: Add test for email lookup endpoint
   - Test GET /users/email/:email with valid/invalid emails
   - Include RBAC validation

3. **Notification Service**: Add test for bulk read operation
   - Test PUT /notifications/read-all functionality
   - Verify bulk update behavior

### Future Improvements (Priority 2)

1. **API Contract Testing**: Implement contract tests between services
2. **Performance Testing**: Add load testing for critical endpoints
3. **Security Testing**: Implement penetration testing scenarios
4. **Documentation**: Generate OpenAPI specs from tests

## Missing Test Implementation Guide

### 1. User Service - Email Lookup

```typescript
it('should get user by email', async () => {
  const response = await app.inject({
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/users/email/test@example.com',
    headers: { 'x-user-id': adminUserId },
  })
  expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200)
  expect(response.json()).toMatchObject({
    email: 'test@example.com',
  })
})
```

### 2. Messaging Service - Get Conversations

```typescript
it('should get user conversations', async () => {
  const response = await app.inject({
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/conversations',
    headers: { 'x-user-id': userId },
  })
  expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200)
  expect(response.json()).toHaveProperty('data')
  expect(response.json().data).toBeInstanceOf(Array)
})
```

### 3. Notification Service - Mark All Read

```typescript
it('should mark all notifications as read', async () => {
  const response = await app.inject({
    method: 'PUT',
    url: '/notifications/read-all',
    headers: { 'x-user-id': userId },
  })
  expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200)
  // Verify all notifications are marked as read
})
```

## Conclusion

The Pika platform demonstrates strong API test coverage at 89%, with three services achieving perfect coverage. The identified gaps are minor and can be addressed quickly. The testing infrastructure is robust, using modern tools and patterns that ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Next Steps

1. Implement the 4 missing endpoint tests
2. Create a CI/CD pipeline check for minimum 90% coverage
3. Generate coverage reports automatically
4. Consider implementing mutation testing for critical paths
