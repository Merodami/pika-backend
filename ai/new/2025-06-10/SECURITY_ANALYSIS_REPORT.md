# Security Analysis Report - Pika Application

## Executive Summary

This security analysis identifies critical vulnerabilities in the Pika application that could lead to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation, and information disclosure. The most significant risks stem from inadequate authorization checks and improper user context validation.

## Critical Security Issues

### 1. Unauthorized Data Access Risk

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Components Affected**: All service repositories  
**Risk**: Users can potentially access or modify data belonging to other users

**Current Implementation Problem**:

- Repository methods rely on simple ID matching without proper ownership verification
- The assumption that `userId === serviceProviderId` is dangerous and unvalidated
- No systematic authorization framework in place

**Example Vulnerability Pattern**:

```typescript
// services/service/src/write/infrastructure/persistence/pgsql/repositories/PrismaServiceWriteRepository.ts
const existingService = await this.prisma.service.findFirst({
  where: {
    id,
    providerId: providerId, // This check can be bypassed if providerId is manipulated
  },
})
```

### 2. Missing Authorization Layer

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Components Affected**: All read operations across services  
**Risk**: Any authenticated user can potentially query all data

**Issues Identified**:

- No user-specific filtering in base repository methods
- Read endpoints don't validate if the requester should access the data
- Booking, Service, and Notification services particularly vulnerable

### 3. Weak User Context Propagation

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Components Affected**: API Gateway, all services  
**Risk**: Context manipulation and impersonation

**Current Implementation**:

- User context passed via headers (`x-user-id`, `x-user-email`)
- No cryptographic verification of header authenticity
- Services blindly trust headers from any source

## High-Risk Security Issues

### 4. Service-to-Service Communication

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Components Affected**: All microservices  
**Risk**: Direct service access bypassing gateway

**Issues**:

- No mutual authentication between services
- Services accessible if network isolation fails
- No request signing or verification

### 5. JWT Implementation Weaknesses

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Components Affected**: Authentication system  
**Risk**: Token compromise and replay attacks

**Issues**:

- Symmetric key algorithm (HS256) instead of asymmetric
- No token fingerprinting or binding
- Refresh token rotation not properly implemented

## Medium-Risk Security Issues

### 6. Input Validation Gaps

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Components Affected**: API schemas, controllers  
**Risk**: Injection attacks, data corruption

**Issues**:

- Basic regex validation for UUIDs
- No content sanitization for user inputs
- Multilingual fields lack proper encoding validation

### 7. Rate Limiting Insufficiency

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Components Affected**: Authentication endpoints  
**Risk**: Brute force and denial of service

**Issues**:

- Global rate limiting exists but not endpoint-specific
- Authentication endpoints need stricter limits
- No progressive delay for failed attempts

### 8. Information Disclosure

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Components Affected**: Error handling  
**Risk**: Internal system information leakage

**Issues**:

- Detailed error messages expose internal state
- Stack traces potentially visible in production
- Database error codes not sanitized

## Architecture-Level Vulnerabilities

### 9. Missing Security Patterns

**Components Affected**: Overall architecture  
**Issues**:

- No implementation of principle of least privilege
- Missing defense in depth strategies
- No security boundaries between domains

### 10. Audit and Monitoring Gaps

**Components Affected**: All services  
**Issues**:

- No comprehensive audit logging
- Missing anomaly detection
- No alerts for suspicious access patterns

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)

1. **Implement Resource-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Add authorization middleware to verify resource ownership
   - Create access control lists for each resource type
   - Never trust client-provided IDs without verification

2. **Fix User-to-Provider Mapping**
   - Create proper repository methods for user context lookup
   - Cache mappings for performance
   - Validate provider status before operations

3. **Add Authorization Checks to All Read Operations**
   - Filter queries by authenticated user context
   - Implement row-level security
   - Add explicit permission checks

### Short-term Improvements (1-2 weeks)

4. **Secure Service Communication**
   - Implement service mesh or mutual TLS
   - Add request signing with HMAC
   - Validate service identity on each request

5. **Enhance JWT Security**
   - Switch to RS256 (asymmetric) algorithm
   - Implement key rotation mechanism
   - Add token binding and fingerprinting

6. **Comprehensive Input Validation**
   - Implement schema validation with Joi/Zod
   - Add content sanitization middleware
   - Validate all user inputs against injection

### Medium-term Enhancements (1 month)

7. **Implement Security Headers**
   - Add Content-Security-Policy
   - Enable Strict-Transport-Security
   - Configure proper CORS policies

8. **Add Audit Logging System**
   - Log all data access attempts
   - Implement centralized logging
   - Add anomaly detection

9. **Security Testing Integration**
   - Add OWASP ZAP to CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement security-focused test cases
   - Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

## Risk Matrix

| Risk                     | Likelihood | Impact   | Priority |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| Unauthorized Data Access | High       | Critical | P0       |
| Missing Authorization    | High       | Critical | P0       |
| Service Impersonation    | Medium     | High     | P1       |
| JWT Compromise           | Low        | High     | P1       |
| Input Validation         | Medium     | Medium   | P2       |
| Information Disclosure   | High       | Low      | P2       |

## Conclusion

The Pika application has a solid architectural foundation but requires immediate attention to authorization and access control mechanisms. The most critical risk is the potential for users to access data that doesn't belong to them due to missing or inadequate authorization checks.

Priority should be given to implementing proper resource-based access control and fixing the user context validation issues. These changes will significantly improve the security posture of the application.

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize the identified vulnerabilities
2. Create implementation tickets for each security fix
3. Establish security review process for new features
4. Implement security training for development team
5. Schedule regular security audits
