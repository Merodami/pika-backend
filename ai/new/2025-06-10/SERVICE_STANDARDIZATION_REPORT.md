# Service Standardization Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of service standardization in the Pika codebase. The analysis reveals that while Category and Service implementations follow industry best practices, other services require improvements to achieve full consistency and maintainability.

**UPDATE**: After deeper analysis, the controller/route pattern is correctly implemented in most services. Controllers return data, routes handle HTTP concerns - this is the correct separation.

## Current State Analysis

### Well-Standardized Services (Gold Standard)

- **Category Service**: Fully implements all patterns correctly
- **Service Service**: Nearly identical to Category, follows all patterns

### Partially Standardized Services

- **User Service**: Good structure but missing key components
- **Booking Service**: Follows structure but lacks essential implementations

### Non-Standard Services

- **Messaging Service**: Firebase-based with different patterns
- **Notification Service**: Firebase-based with minimal structure

## Key Findings

### 1. Mapper Pattern Inconsistencies

**Problem**: Not all services use the standardized mapper pattern for DTO transformations.

**Current State**:

- ✅ Category/Service: Use comprehensive SDK mappers with proper interfaces
- ❌ User/Booking: Use inline mapping directly in controllers
- ❌ Messaging/Notification: Direct DTO usage without mapping layer

**Required Actions**:

- Implement UserMapper class following CategoryMapper pattern (COMPLETED)
- Create BookingMapper with fromDocument, toDTO, and fromDTO methods
- Consider creating FirebaseMapper base class for Messaging/Notification

### 2. Response Handling Patterns

**UPDATE**: After code review, the pattern is correctly implemented in most services.

**Correct Pattern**:

- Controllers return data (no `reply.send()`)
- Routes handle HTTP concerns (`reply.code().send()`)

**Current State**:

- ✅ Category/Service/User: Controllers return values, routes handle HTTP
- ⚠️ Messaging/Notification: Need verification if controllers use `reply.send()`

**Required Actions**:

- Verify Messaging/Notification controllers only return data
- Ensure consistent Content-Language header handling in routes
- Document the correct pattern for clarity

### 3. Error Handling

**Problem**: Incomplete error handling in repositories.

**Current State**:

- ✅ Category: Comprehensive Prisma error code handling
- ⚠️ Other services: Basic error handling, missing edge cases

**Required Actions**:

- Add Prisma error code handling to User repository
- Add Prisma error code handling to Booking repository
- Create shared error handling utilities for common Prisma errors
- Implement proper error context and correlation IDs

### 4. Request Validation

**Problem**: While schemas exist, not all services use them consistently.

**Current State**:

- ✅ All services have schemas defined in @pika/api
- ⚠️ Not all routes properly apply schema validation

**Required Actions**:

- Audit all routes to ensure schema validation is applied
- Add missing response schemas where applicable
- Ensure propertyTransformerHook is used consistently

### 5. Testing Coverage

**Problem**: Significant gap in integration test coverage.

**Current State**:

- ✅ Category: Comprehensive integration tests with testcontainers
- ❌ Other services: Minimal or no integration tests

**Required Actions**:

- Create integration tests for User service following Category pattern
- Create integration tests for Booking service
- Implement shared test fixtures and utilities
- Add contract testing between services

### 6. Sorting and Filtering

**Problem**: Inconsistent implementation of sorting adapters.

**Current State**:

- ✅ Category/Service: Use sorting adapters with proper field mapping
- ❌ User: Missing sorting adapter implementation

**Required Actions**:

- Implement UserSortingAdapter
- Ensure all list endpoints support consistent sorting
- Add filtering capabilities where missing

### 7. Caching Strategy

**Problem**: Inconsistent use of caching decorators.

**Current State**:

- ✅ Category: Uses @Cache decorator appropriately
- ⚠️ Other services: Sporadic or no caching

**Required Actions**:

- Identify cacheable endpoints in all services
- Apply @Cache decorator consistently
- Implement cache invalidation strategies

### 8. Firebase Services

**Problem**: Firebase-based services follow different patterns due to their nature.

**Current State**:

- Different repository patterns
- Different response handling
- Limited structure compared to SQL-based services

**Required Actions**:

- Create separate pattern documentation for Firebase services
- Consider creating base classes for Firebase repositories
- Standardize Firebase error handling

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Immediate)

1. Complete BookingMapper implementation
2. Add comprehensive error handling to User and Booking repositories
3. Standardize response handling in Messaging/Notification services

### Medium Priority (This Sprint)

1. Implement sorting adapters for User service
2. Create integration tests for User and Booking services
3. Apply caching decorators consistently

### Low Priority (Next Sprint)

1. Create service generator/template
2. Document Firebase service patterns
3. Implement contract testing

## Best Practices to Follow

### 1. Clean Architecture Principles

- Maintain clear separation between layers
- Dependencies flow inward (controllers → use cases → domain)
- Infrastructure details stay in infrastructure layer

### 2. DDD + CQRS Pattern

- Strict separation of read and write operations
- Domain entities as the core business logic
- Use cases orchestrate business operations

### 3. Dependency Injection

- Constructor injection for all dependencies
- Interfaces (ports) for all infrastructure concerns
- Easy testing through mock implementations

### 4. Error Handling Strategy

- Use ErrorFactory for consistent error creation
- Include correlation IDs for tracing
- Handle all Prisma error codes appropriately
- Provide meaningful error messages

### 5. Response Patterns

- Controllers return values, not send responses
- Use processMultilingualContent for language handling
- Set appropriate HTTP headers (Content-Language)
- Consistent pagination response structure

### 6. Testing Strategy

- Integration tests with real databases (testcontainers)
- Test all CRUD operations
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Use shared test fixtures

## Recommended Tools and Utilities

### 1. Shared Utilities Needed

- PrismaErrorHandler: Common Prisma error handling
- BaseRepository: Abstract repository with common operations
- TestFixtureBuilder: Consistent test data creation
- SortingAdapter base class

### 2. Development Tools

- Service generator based on Category template
- Linting rules to enforce patterns
- Pre-commit hooks for validation

## Success Metrics

1. **Code Consistency**: All services follow the same patterns
2. **Test Coverage**: >80% integration test coverage
3. **Error Handling**: Zero unhandled Prisma errors
4. **Response Time**: Consistent response patterns across services
5. **Maintainability**: New developers can understand patterns quickly

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this standardization plan
2. Create detailed tickets for each improvement
3. Assign priorities and sprint planning
4. Begin implementation starting with high-priority items
5. Regular code reviews to ensure compliance

## Conclusion

The Category and Service implementations represent industry best practices and should serve as the reference architecture. By following this standardization plan, we can achieve a consistent, maintainable, and scalable codebase that follows clean architecture principles and industry standards.
